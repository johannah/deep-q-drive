# Deep-Q Driving 
A little project with a simple implementation of deep q-learning with experience replay. The "car" pixel learns to successfully navigate a winding road by choosing one of three moves ("left", "straight", "right") based on the 16x16 pixel input of the path. Depends on keras, numpy.
